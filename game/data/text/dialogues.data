LevelOne My gosh where am I?  What is this letter even saying?  I'm so confused.  OH WAIT!  I'm Captain Proton, and I teleported somewhere weird!  Where is my ship and Turvy!?  [Press any key to continue]
LevelOneInstruct I should remember these commands, they might be useful for me!  Just don't press escape during mid game otherwise I'd have to restart!  I'm up for this adventure.  Wish me luck!
LevelTwo That was so hard.  Wait, there's even harder things?  WHERE IS MY SHIP?  TURVY?!  WHY ARE YOU SO ADVENTUROUS.  Eh, this is pretty fun for myself too, come at me alien world.
LevelThree I almost died many times and I still have to go through more?  What's even next?  Alien- oh wait.  Great. Just great.  Didn't realize I'm abducted.  [Insert passive aggressive emoji]
LevelFour I'm so dizzy from all those trampolines and so terrified from those monsters.  But now teleports?  I didn't sign up for this!!!!  Definitely filing a lawsuit when I get back.  TURVY PLEASE STAY IN ONE PLACE.
