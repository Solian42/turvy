Hey All! This is our codebase.

PROGRRESS FOR ASSIGNMENT 6:

Brian Cueto:  Added a new mechanic to the game:  checkpoints!  If you collide with a
checkpoint, then you will respawn at that position.  If you die from spikes, then
you will end up at the last checkpoint that you touched. This should be marked by
a different image from the platforms/spikes (it will be noticeable in game).

Also added a new state that is seen before the first level.  After starting a new game
from the main menu, the player will see a screen that says "Level One",
and tells the player to press space in order to start the first level.
After pressing space, the player is directed to the game state to play the actual game.

We have a legit game now!
We have decided to call it "Turvy" (As in topsy-turvy)

It's kinda difficult as you learn the mechanics, then it gets a lot easier, this makes
getting the trophy possible, but difficult.

We decided to start your score at 100,000, and subtract 500 points every time you die. You
die whenever you collide spikes. When you die, you respawn at the bottom left of the
level. 

The score effectively gives you 200 lives, and rewards you for losing at little as 
possible. Currently we can only remember one high score between games, but hey, we're a 
poor independent studio with no money. :P

Let us know what your high score is! :)

All of our source code is in src, .h files in include, music, images, fonts and levels
in data.


hope it works well! :D
