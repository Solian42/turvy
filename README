Hey All! This is our codebase.

To Build:

navigate to game/src, and run "make"

To Run:

navigate to game/bin, and run ./lizard

To Clean:

run "make remove" from game/src

This took forever to build, but it was really fun learning how exactly to do things, while
encountering tons of weird bugs and various other difficulties.

All of our source code is in src, .h files in include

hope it works well! :D
