Hey All! This is our codebase.

PROGRRESS FOR ASSIGNMENT 7:

Brian Cueto:  Designed the 2nd level and wrote the xml file for it.  This level is much more
difficult that the first, and will require more thought into how to maneuver the character
through certain areas.  Please play somewhat slowly if you have an issue with dying too much
at a certain area, it will help.
Also added a new feature:  coins!  Get these coins with the character and your high score will
increase.

Anthony Kim: Fixed a collision detection bug, which resulted in player getting stuck
inside a platform when he enters from the side of the platform. Also, redesigned the
platform skins, and made some other tile-based pixel graphics for future use.


Tristan Orton-Urbina:
Fixed checkpoints not appearing on the screen, cleaned up various memory leaks. Created
new sprite for checkpoints + did preliminary work on creating level editor. I tried to
do some tile-based rendering stuffs but ran out of time. Isn't necessary right now, but I
will hopefully have it ready for next week! 

To Build:

navigate to game/src, and run "make"

To Run:

navigate to game/bin, and run ./lizard

To Clean:

run "make remove" from game/src

BUGS: Platform collision is still wonky (less than it used to be, though). 
We're working on that.

##########################################################################################

How to Play:

Left/Right: Corresponding arrowkeys
Change Gravity: Spacebar (only when standing on platforms)
Quit: Esc
Show FPS: F
From Game->Main menu: Q


All others should be self explanatory!

We have a legit game now!
We have decided to call it "Turvy" (As in topsy-turvy)

It's kinda difficult as you learn the mechanics, then it gets a lot easier, this makes
getting the trophy possible, but difficult.

We decided to start your score at 100,000, and subtract 500 points every time you die. You
die whenever you collide spikes. When you die, you respawn at the bottom left of the
level. 

The score effectively gives you 200 lives, and rewards you for losing at little as 
possible. Currently we can only remember one high score between games, but hey, we're a 
poor independent studio with no money. :P

Let us know what your high score is! :)

All of our source code is in src, .h files in include, music, images, fonts and levels
in data.


hope it works well! :D
