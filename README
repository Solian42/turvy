So, I guess we're supposed to build a game or something. Crazy.

File Locations:

Products and intermediaries should be built to lizard/Game/Build/Products and lizard/Game/Build/Intermediaries (you have to create those files yourselves, don't add them to git)
Source files and headers are in lizard/Game/Game/
