Hey All! This is our codebase.

##########################################################################################

PROGRRESS FOR ASSIGNMENT 9:

Goals:
1. Fixing Coins:
    Previously, coins did not disappear on contact.  Also another bug in which if you
    hit a second coin, the score did not increment.  These issues were fixed.  Coins now
    disappear and multiple coins are now possible as scoring issues were fixed.
2. Add audio feedback for hitting coins/checkpoints:
    Player collision with coins/checkpoints did not have a sound and made the game boring
    in that aspect.  Now there is a sound when the player collides with a coin or
    checkpoint.
3. Fixing Trampoline collision issues:
    There were some issues with trampoline collisions, such as some space between the player
    and the trampoline that exists when collision occurs, and also some problems in which when
    the player goes back onto a platform, the player is in the wrong orientation and the input is
    glitched.  This is now fixed, so actual collision is visibly working and the player's physics
    and inputs are working well too.
4. Creating Death/Respawn Animation for the player:
    Added some animation to when the player dies and respawns.  Cool animation to make our
    game more intersting.
5. Incorporating enemies to level 3:
    Enemies was a feature made LAST assignment, but were not actually placed in level 3.
    We did place them in before the Beta presentation.  This is technically not a new
    feature, just a feature we originally had but did not implement into our current game
    until now.
6. Adding enemy animation:
    Enemies did not have animation.  They now animate as their eyes blinks.
7. Multiple background graphics and music:
    Each level now has a different background as well as different music, so the game will
    not be too boring.
8. Adding "God Mode":
    This is not really a new feature, more just something we added before the Beta presentation
    to help with demoing and testing levels.  After pressing "g" during a level, the player is
    unkillable.
9. Multiple Platform/Spike graphics:
    Previously, we used the same graphics for platforms and spikes in every level which made the
    game a bit boring.  Now we have different graphics for the platforms and spikes per each level.
    This is based on a theme that correlates with the background!
10. Adding More Coins to Level 2:
    Due to the issue with coins, which is now fixed, we can now have multiple coins for each level
    when it is implemented.
11. Cleaning Up Code Base:
    Code base has a bunch of code that was commented out, as well as some other comments that did not
    match our current implementation.  We cleaned this stuff out, so our files would not be too messy
    with unecessary comments/code.
12. Redesigning Level 3:
    Level 3 is now more interesting with many trampolines and coins all over.

Individual Achievements This Week:

Anthony: Fixed "multiple coins not working" issue, and made many many new sprites, background,
and other resources to incorporate into the game.

Brian:  Added enemies to level 3, got enemies to animate, incorporated sound to checkpoint and
coin collision, cleaned up unecessary comments/code and mess in code base, redesigned level 3 and
added more coins in level 2 and 3.  

Tristan:
Implemented new sprites for platforms, fixed collision issues on the trampolines, 
implemented a "pause" button. I also created a death animation for the player so that 
dying isn't so quick. I also fixed several audio-related bugs that came up.

To Build:

navigate to game/src, and run "make"

To Run:

navigate to game/bin, and run ./lizard

To Clean:

run "make remove" from game/src

BUGS: Platform collision is still wonky (less than it used to be, though). 
We're working on that.

How to Play:

Left/Right: Corresponding arrowkeys
Change Gravity: Spacebar (only when standing on platforms)
Quit: Esc
Show FPS: F
From Game->Main menu: Q

Cheat Codes:
R: reset to last checkpoint w/ no penalty
2: Teleport to beginning of level 2
C: Teleport to last checkpoint in a level
G: Godmode. 
P: Pause (press return in the console to unpause)

All others should be self explanatory!

We have a legit game now!
We have decided to call it "Turvy" (As in topsy-turvy)

It's kinda difficult as you learn the mechanics, then it gets a lot easier, this makes
getting the trophy possible, but difficult.

We decided to start your score at 100,000, and subtract 500 points every time you die. You
die whenever you collide spikes. When you die, you respawn at the bottom left of the
level. 

The score effectively gives you 200 lives, and rewards you for losing at little as 
possible. Currently we can only remember one high score between games, but hey, we're a 
poor independent studio with no money. :P

Let us know what your high score is! :)

All of our source code is in src, .h files in include, music, images, fonts and levels
in data.


hope it works well! :D
