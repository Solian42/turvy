Hey All! This is our codebase.

PROGRRESS FOR ASSIGNMENT 10:

Brian Cueto:
Added a new feature: teleports!  Once the player enters a teleport, the player gets teleported to a new location.  The teleport has animation, and there is just a rough graphic for the destination for now.  I also added a dialogue object, so storyline/instructions are more interactive and not boring.  Press s to skip a dialogue when you see it.

To Build:

navigate to game/src, and run "make"

To Run:

To Clean:

run "make remove" from game/src

BUGS: Platform collision is still wonky (less than it used to be, though). 
We're working on that.

##########################################################################################

How to Play:

Left/Right: Corresponding arrowkeys
Change Gravity: Spacebar (only when standing on platforms)
Quit: Esc
Show FPS: F
From Game->Main menu: Q

Cheat Codes:
R: reset to last checkpoint w/ no penalty
2: Teleport to beginning of level 2
C: Teleport to last checkpoint in a level

All others should be self explanatory!

Level Editor:
* Navigate through objects to place using keys 1-7.
   (1: Platform, 2: Spike, 3: Checkpoint, 4: Coin, 5: Trampoline, 6: Enemy, 7: Objective)
* Drag and release to set an object in place.
* Press "Space" to save and quit. (XML file is saved to /data/levels/level_editor.xml)
* For creative convenience, press "x" to toggle x-coordinate lock mode, so you can drag&draw horizontal platforms,
   and "z" to toggle y-coordinate lock mode, so you can drag and draw vertiacal platforms.
* Use arrow keys to navigate througout the world.
* Use "WASD" keys to set directions of the spike(N,S,W,E directions)
* "c" key toggles on view coordinate mode.

We have a legit game now!
We have decided to call it "Turvy" (As in topsy-turvy)

It's kinda difficult as you learn the mechanics, then it gets a lot easier, this makes
getting the trophy possible, but difficult.

We decided to start your score at 100,000, and subtract 500 points every time you die. You
die whenever you collide spikes. When you die, you respawn at the bottom left of the
level. 

The score effectively gives you 200 lives, and rewards you for losing at little as 
possible. Currently we can only remember one high score between games, but hey, we're a 
poor independent studio with no money. :P

Let us know what your high score is! :)

All of our source code is in src, .h files in include, music, images, fonts and levels
in data.


hope it works well! :D
