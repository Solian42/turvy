Hey All! This is our codebase.

##########################################################################################

PROGRRESS FOR ASSIGNMENT 8:

Brian Cueto:  Added a new feature:  Gravity Switchers! (Called Trampoline in code for
convenience).  These platforms work such that if you hit them, they automatically
switch your gravity.  So think of it as you're on a platform and you press space to
switch gravity, except you don't have any input. (Also added a graphic for it).
Re-added another feature:  Enemy aliens are now back!  No longer spawn in random locations
from the earlier assignment, but can be set through our level xml files with an x, y, and
a direction that tells us how it moves.  If you hit it, your score decreases and you respawn
at the previous checkpoint.  
Added a pre-level 3 state that also gives some storyline and a hint as to what is to come for
level 3.  This is how things are for the levels for now, but we will make this different later
to be more interesting and engaging to whoever is playing instead of a block of text. (I also
did the pre-level 2 state for Assingment 7, but did not list in the README for that
asssignment)

Anthony Kim: Added xml parser connectivity to the new coin system, made score increment
logic upon coin collision, made sprites for coin, and still working on level editor,
which is a lot more work than expected. Complete graphic level editor is coming soon.


Tristan Orton-Urbina:
Rebuilt engine so that it is now tile based (for platforms and spikes), changed rendering
logic so that we don't take a huge performance penalty for using small tiles. rewrote how
the player reacts to collisions + changed gamestate so that we can have seamless
transitions between levels. Also added shortcuts & squashed bug.

To Build:

navigate to game/src, and run "make"

To Run:

navigate to game/bin, and run ./lizard

To Clean:

run "make remove" from game/src

BUGS: Platform collision is still wonky (less than it used to be, though). 
We're working on that.

How to Play:

Left/Right: Corresponding arrowkeys
Change Gravity: Spacebar (only when standing on platforms)
Quit: Esc
Show FPS: F
From Game->Main menu: Q

Cheat Codes:
R: reset to last checkpoint w/ no penalty
2: Teleport to beginning of level 2
C: Teleport to last checkpoint in a level


All others should be self explanatory!

We have a legit game now!
We have decided to call it "Turvy" (As in topsy-turvy)

It's kinda difficult as you learn the mechanics, then it gets a lot easier, this makes
getting the trophy possible, but difficult.

We decided to start your score at 100,000, and subtract 500 points every time you die. You
die whenever you collide spikes. When you die, you respawn at the bottom left of the
level. 

The score effectively gives you 200 lives, and rewards you for losing at little as 
possible. Currently we can only remember one high score between games, but hey, we're a 
poor independent studio with no money. :P

Let us know what your high score is! :)

All of our source code is in src, .h files in include, music, images, fonts and levels
in data.


hope it works well! :D
