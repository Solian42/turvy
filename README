Hey All! This is our codebase.

To Build:

navigate to game/src, and run "make"

To Run:

navigate to game/bin, and run ./lizard

To Clean:

run "make remove" from game/src

This took forever to build, but it was really fun learning how exactly to do things, while
encountering tons of weird bugs and various other difficulties.

We're now properly implementing an entity component system! We have state-based frames,
and it all looks cool.

We also implemented the jumping mechanic that we want to use in the game, let us know how
you like it!

All of our source code is in src, .h files in include, music, images, and fonts in data

hope it works well! :D
