Hey All! This is our codebase.

PROGRRESS FOR ASSIGNMENT 11:

Brian Cueto:
Added animation to teleporting, so it is more entertaining.  Expanded level 4.  Level 4
is now much more difficult (LOL) but more complete.  Have fun, and use the God mode option
if needed.  Look at the walkthrough before for help.  

Tristan:
Added framework for rendering arbitrary text (fast!) to dialogue boxes. Also cleaned up
lingering bugs with level editor and states. Added music and implemented textures for the
new level.

Anthony: Finally fixed the collision bug. As far as I've tested, it's impossible to get
stuck inside a platform now. Also integrated the new sprites into life on levels 2 
through 4.

LEVEL 4 WALKTHROUGH: This level can get quite annoying with all the teleports, if you want
to win the game fast, go through this path:
1. On the first "cave", go to the bottom right most teleport.
2. You will then be teleported to the "teleport swirl" cave.  Here, go to the bottom
right most teleport too.
3. You are now in a new cave.  Go to the top left most teleport.
4. Here you are at the final cave.  Going through these spike walls can be tricky.  Just
lean up on one wall, shift gravity, and time it correctly.  

OTHER FEATURES:  It's fun if you explore this level, it gets hard by there is plenty
of checkpoints.  There is also one "cave" that is just full of coins (our best attempt
at making an "Easter egg" for this game).

To Build:

navigate to game/src, and run "make"

To Run:

navigate to game/bin, and run ./lizard

To Clean:

run "make remove" from game/src

##########################################################################################

BUGS: Platform collision is still wonky (less than it used to be, though). 
We're working on that.

How to Play:

Left/Right: Corresponding arrowkeys
Change Gravity: Spacebar (only when standing on platforms)
Quit: Esc
Show FPS: F
From Game->Main menu: Q

Cheat Codes:
R: reset to last checkpoint w/ no penalty
(2, 3, 4): Teleport to beginning of level (2, 3, 4)
C: Teleport to last checkpoint in a level
G: Godmode. 
P: Pause (press return in the console to unpause)

All others should be self explanatory!

##########################################################################################

Level Editor:
* Navigate through objects to place using keys 1-6.
   (1: Platform, 2: Spike, 3: Checkpoint, 4: Coin, 5: Trampoline, 6: Enemy)
* Drag and release to set an object in place.
* Press "Space" to save and quit. (XML file is saved to /data/levels/level_editor.xml)
* For creative convenience, press "x" to toggle x-coordinate lock mode, so you can drag&draw horizontal platforms,
   and "z" to toggle y-coordinate lock mode, so you can drag and draw vertiacal platforms.
* Use arrow keys to navigate througout the world.
* Use "WASD" keys to set directions of the spike(N,S,W,E directions)
* "c" key toggles on view coordinate mode.

We have a legit game now!
We have decided to call it "Turvy" (As in topsy-turvy)

It's kinda difficult as you learn the mechanics, then it gets a lot easier, this makes
getting the trophy possible, but difficult.

We decided to start your score at 100,000, and subtract 500 points every time you die. You
die whenever you collide spikes. When you die, you respawn at the bottom left of the
level. 

The score effectively gives you 200 lives, and rewards you for losing at little as 
possible. Currently we can only remember one high score between games, but hey, we're a 
poor independent studio with no money. :P

Let us know what your high score is! :)

All of our source code is in src, .h files in include, music, images, fonts and levels
in data.


hope it works well! :D
