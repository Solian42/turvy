We have a legit game now!
We have decided to call it "Turvy" (As in topsy-turvy)

It's kinda difficult, but that's the point. We found in testing that this was a good
number of enemies to give a good game. Making getting the trophy possible, but difficult.

We decided to start your score at 100,000, and subtract 500 points every time you die. You
die whenever you collide with an enemy. When you die, you respawn at the shielded area
down at the bottom left of the screen. 

The score effectively gives you 200 lives, and rewards you for losing at little as 
possible. Currently we can only remember one high score between games, but hey, we're a 
poor independent studio with no money. :P

Let us know what your high score is! :)

All of our source code is in src, .h files in include, music, images, and fonts in data

hope it works well! :D
