Vision:

Our protagonist, Captain To-Be-Named, has been teleported to an alternate dimension, where he/she has gained control over gravity, and now must escape by solving difficult and dangerous puzzles with this newfound power.

bThe game takes place in an alternate dimension, where everything looks really 16-bit. There are spikes on a lot of surfaces, and various other deadly traps that you must avoid to complete levels. The environment is mostly static, but has some moving elements to add additional gameplay complexity. The music is rather chip-tune like.

We can have an infinite amount of levels, with checkpoints at the beginning/in the middle of each level. Each level will be one screen, we will start with 5, but can always increase the amount. The first level will be a tutorial of sorts, where the player either learns the mechanics, or dies a lot until they do. The 2nd level will have a little bit more of a challenging puzzle that may take some thought on how to solve. The 3rd level and onwards will increase the difficulty and require more advanced controls to get past it. Each level may also introduce a new mechanic, such as moving blocks in the level, or other powerups/collectibles. The outcome of each level will be progressing to the next one! 

The basic mechanics of the game will be that the player character can move left/right, but cannot jump. Instead of jumping, the player can flip the direction of gravity if they are standing on a surface. The skill involved will mostly be dexterity/figuring out the correct path through a level. The main way that they player can die is by colliding with various amount of spikes or other static traps scattered throughout the level. Levels will stick to the overall theme/setting, perhaps deviating in color scheme and each having their own. There is no concept if HP, if you touch spikes, you die. You can always go back in levels, and you can teleport to any checkpoint that you have already passed from the main menu. The player has an infinite amount of lives, and their high-score is based on how many times they die, less being better.

Game Plan:

Milestones:
Alpha: Oct 5th: Main Menu, with barebones 1st level. (2 platforms top and bottom of the screen, can move in-between them)
Beta: Nov 2nd: Full 1st and 2nd levels (spikes and all). 
Gold: Dec 14th: All 5 levels minimum with checkpoints, possibly more by changing it to a 2-leveled structure. (multiple “worlds” with ~5 levels each).

Responsibilities:
Tristan: Technical Lead, I will build the base of the engine, and help with level creation. I will also submit group files.
Brian: I will design how the levels look like and build them.  I will also help with the engine development (with Tristan) and art/graphics (with Anthony).  
Anthony: Art & music hunter, I will create or pull graphic/sound resources from the internet. I will work with Brian on level design as well as helping out Tristan on implementing the game mechanics.

Risks:
The game is not fun/is too difficult: we will rebuild levels to lower the difficulty/ make the game more “fun” based on feedback from friends + peers in the class.
Someone finds their role too difficult: We will meet to discuss this, and see if we can shift responsibilities around so that everyone’s life is easier.
The codebase becomes difficult to read/manage, possibly impacting performance: We will schedule a large block of time to go through and attempt to refactor the codebase, making it more efficient. To mitigate this, we will also stick to a strict coding style (clang-format llvm). 

Technical Decisions: 
We will be using C++ to build this game.
We will be using git over bitbucket for source/version control.
Team communication will be done over facebook chat.
We will not insure cross-platform compatibility.
